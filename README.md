GAME INSTRUCTIONS

      TRY-N-GO! is a digital board game that is to be played as a desktop app. The board is a triangular board with 36 distinctive triangular slots. Players (red and blue) are each given 23 triangular game pieces of their own respective player colors. The game objective is to collect more points than the opposing player by the time all game pieces have been played and no more points may be claimed. Points are earned by claiming triangles constructed from game pieces. Triangles may be claimed when multiple game pieces (red or blue) are put together to form a larger triangle. Triangles may be claimed by the player with the greatest percent ownership of it. Claimed triangles reward different point values depending on size. For 4-piece triangles, 2 points are awarded. For 9-piece triangles, 5 points are awarded.  Players alternate turns by placing a game piece within a game tile and optionally claiming a constructed triangle for points when available (individual game pieces and the board itself may not be claimed for points). When triangles are claimed, all the game pieces in it must be discarded for the remainder of the game. By the time that all game pieces/turns have been used up (23 turns for each player), the player with the higher points wins. If they have the same amount of points, then there is a draw.
